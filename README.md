If the credentials are not correct, the program will terminate and the user will be asked to fix them.
If the database does not exist, it will be created.
If the records table does not already exist in the database, will be created.
if the database is empty, it will be populated with a couple of records as examples.

create database wsaa_project;
use wsaa_project
create table records (id int AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, title varchar(250), artist varchar(250), year int, genre varchar(250));

## API Definition
The parameters are:

ID - the ID that the program assigns to the entry
Title - the name of the record
Artist - the artist / band featuring on the record
Year - the year the record was released
Genre - The type of music, e.g. Jazz, Rock, Prog, Folk, Punk, Disco

The API will implement the following operations:

| Operation | Method | URL | Sample Parameters | Sample Responses |
|-----------|--------|-----|-------------------|------------------|
| Get All | GET | /records | None | [{...},{...},{...}] |
| Find by ID | GET | /records/id | None | {"id":"1", "Title" : "xxx", |
| | | | | "Artist":"xxx", "Year":1973,|
| | | | | "Genre":"Rock"} |
| Create | POST | /records | {"Title" : "xxx", | {"id":"1", "Title" : "xxx", |
| | | |  "Artist":"xxx", "Year":1973, | "Artist":"xxx", "Year":1973,|
| | | |  "Genre":"Rock"} | "Genre":"Rock"} |
| Update | PUT | /records/id | e.g. {"Year":1970} | {"id":"1", "Title" : "xxx", |
| | | | | "Artist":"xxx", "Year":1970,|
| | | | | "Genre":"Rock"} |
| Delete | DELETE | /records/id | None | {"done":True} |

As the program will be implemented in stages, curl will be used to test the server-side functionality.

### Sample CURL commands
Following commands are used with the web server running on localhost.

#### Get All
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/records

#### Find by ID
5 is just an example, and can be changed.
curl -X GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/records/5

#### Create
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"title\":\"Closer\", \"artist\":\"Joy Division\", \"year\":1981, \"genre\":\"post punk\"}" http://127.0.0.1:5000/records

#### Update
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"title\":\"Further\"}" http://127.0.0.1:5000/records/5
